 ## :beginner: About


The layout is built using  Flexbox and media queries. through this course I learned  many things like flexing items, styling them and how to build website responsively.
The content is static shows how I am living the simple life. 
and the main goals of this website is to learn more about Html and CSS and to build the websites responsively with flexBox and media queries 
Flexbox is an approach to layout creation, alignment of elements and distribution of extra space.
Flex stands for flexible, adaptive. Flexboxes are thus flexible elements of the layout. 
One of the main advantages of flexbox is the ability to fill extra space without the need to use Javascript.
